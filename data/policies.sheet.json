    "question": "What do you think about the city seeking new and more progressive taxes?",
    "durkan": "New and more progressive taxes could help Seattle pay for services. But the city should focus on solutions that don’t need or are more likely to win state Legislative approval, such as tax breaks for low-income homeowners and landlords who cap rents.",
    "moon": "Seattle should seek to tax capital gains, vacant properties and non-resident homeowners and should seek to tax large businesses at a higher rate. Some changes may involve litigation or require Legislative approval, but barriers can be overcome."

  {
    "question": "What do you think about the city moving to rely more on short-term rent vouchers to help people experiencing homelessness?",
    "durkan": "Short-term rent vouchers should be one of many approaches the city uses for people with various needs. The city’s goal should be getting people into homes, and short-term vouchers can sometimes accomplish that quicker and cheaper than other approaches.",
    "moon": "Short-term rent vouchers only work well for a limited number of people. The city should move away from relying heavily on short-term vouchers because people with low incomes often become homeless again after their vouchers run out."

  {
    "question": "What do you think about police reform in Seattle?",
    "durkan": "Important progress has been made in recent years. Police officers are using less force and the department is more transparent than it was. But the work must continue.",
    "moon": "The change is just beginning. The civilian, appointed Community Police Commission should be given direct oversight over the department, rather than an advisory role."

  {
    "question": "What do you think about whether Seattle should guarantee everyone a “right to shelter?”",
    "durkan": "Seattle should add hundreds of additional beds to its homeless-shelter system. But the city should not adopt a “right to shelter” ordinance because scarce resources that otherwise could be used to provide people with permanent housing would need to be used to fight lawsuits and to warehouse people in degrading shelters.",
    "moon": "Seattle should adopt a “right to shelter” ordinance because housing is a human right and because everyone deserves shelter. The city should develop a plan to deliver on such an ordinance. New taxes could potentially help pay for additional shelter beds."
  },
  {
    "question": "What do you think about sweeps, also called cleanups, removals or evictions, of unauthorized homeless encampments?",
    "durkan": "Most unauthorized encampments are unsafe and unhealthy, and allowing people to live in them is immoral. People shouldn’t be forced to leave unauthorized encampments without better places to go, however. The city should add more shelter and housing, so it can relocate people out of unauthorized encampments and shut them down.",
    "moon": "Sweeps are wrong. Only a small percentage of unauthorized encampments are truly unsafe. In many cases, evicting people from unauthorized encampments disrupts their lives and makes them less safe. When unauthorized encampments are truly unsafe, the city should offer services to people with the goal of bringing them to safer places."

  {
    "question": "What do you think about the city’s allowing taller buildings while requiring developers with projects there to help create some low-income apartments?",
    "durkan": "The strategy isn’t perfect but it’s the best tool available to increase the city’s supply of affordable housing immediately. The city should respect differences between communities but move ahead quickly and not be distracted by less-immediate strategies.",
    "moon": "The strategy is a first step. But the city should take time to talk more with communities and consider adding more density in affluent communities than in those experiencing gentrification. And the strategy is inadequate because it relies on the private market."

    "question": "Should King County move ahead with its new juvenile courthouse and detention center under construction in the Central District?",
    "durkan": "Yes. The county’s existing facility is substandard and some youth, such as those who commit violent assaults and homicides, must continue to be detained, so the new facility is needed. The new facility in a way that reflects a philosophy of holistic family services while working to further reduce its use of detention.",
    "moon": "No. The county should stop building the new facility, which devotes too much space to detention. It should re-scope the project and return to the voters with a new proposal. And it should prioritize funding for restorative justice and alternatives to detention."

    "question": "What professional experience do you want the next mayor to have?",
    "durkan": "Worked as an attorney in private practice on high-profile cases. Appointed by President Barack Obama as U.S. Attorney for Western Washington. Served as in the prosecutorial role from 2009 to 2014 and worked on police reform. Joined a large law firm to help corporations with cyber security. Longtime adviser to former Gov. Christine Gregoire.",
    "moon": "Worked as an operations manager for small companies, including her family’s manufacturing business. Ran a solo planning and urban design studio from 1998 to 2005, worked on a Pioneer Square neighborhood plan. Cofounded the People’s Waterfront Coalition to advocate for civic space along Seattle’s downtown waterfront."

    "question": "What was the right response to child sexual-abuse claims against former Mayor Ed Murray, who resigned in September after a cousin became his fifth accuser?",
    "durkan": "Initially showed caution, telling The Stranger in April, “It’s not my place to comment” and “The judicial process has to play itself out.” First called for Murray to resign in May, after he announced he would no longer run for re-election. Criticized Murray at the time and for using his public office “to demean and even silence victims.” Stuck to that position.",
    "moon": "Accepted Murray’s endorsement in June and declined for months to call for his resignation, citing uncertainty about the claims. In July, after The Seattle Times reported that an Oregon child-welfare investigator had determined in 1984 that Murray had likely abused his foster son, urged Murray to “reflect deeply” on whether to stay in office. Finally called for Murray to step down on the day he announced his resignation."

    "question": "How should the next mayor be bankrolling her campaign?",
    "durkan": "$580,000 raised as of Sept. 21. Nearly 2,500 contributors, with an average contribution of about $223. Top contributors include attorneys and Microsoft and Amazon employees. 27 percent of money from outside Seattle. Backed by a PAC funded by business groups.",
    "moon": "$211,000 raised as of Sept. 21. Nearly 500 contributors, with an average contribution of $203. About half of the money from the candidate herself. 10 percent of money from outside Seattle. Support from employees of some local architecture and design firms."

  {
    "question": "Whose endorsements do you care about and trust?",
    "durkan": "Former mayors Ed Murray and Charles Royer, former governors Christine Gregoire and Gary Locke, Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce, Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund, Martin Luther King County Labor Council, 20 union locals, The Seattle Times",
    "moon": "Former Mayor Mike McGinn, Sierra Club’s Seattle Group, King County Democrats, Democracy for America, Transit Riders Union, SEIU Local 6, SEIU Local 925, Upgrade Seattle, Seattle Subway, The Stranger, The Urbanist"

  {
    "question": "Where should the next mayor stand on taxing foreign buyers and vacant properties?",
    "durkan": "Has written about speculators, including investors from China, distorting local real-estate markets and driving up housing prices. Says Seattle should study the problem and consider taxing non-resident owners, vacant properties and luxury real-estate.",
    "moon": "Initially attacked opponents for proposing taxes on non-resident owners, saying it could stoke discrimination against people from other countries. But now is calling for the city to explore taxing speculation around short-term flips, second homes and vacant properties."
  },
  {
    "question": "What do you think about allow denser housing to be built in neighborhoods currently reserved for single-family houses?",
    "durkan": "Every part of the city must become denser. But the city shouldn’t take a “one-size-fits-all approach.” More townhomes and mother-in-law apartments are appropriate for some neighborhoods. Transportation choices and other amenities must accompany growth.",
    "moon": "Yes. There should be denser housing and a more flexible land-use code in all zones. Seattle has more land allocated to single-family houses than ever before, which is problematic. More townhomes, rowhomes, duplexes and cottages should be built."
